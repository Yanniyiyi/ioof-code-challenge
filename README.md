## Date difference
### How to run
Download the folder, run the index.html in browser.
### Assumptions
1. I assume that all the input is follow the 'DD MM YYYY' format.
2. Each pair of date is in a single line. 
3. Date pairs could be stored in a `txt` file as input. The format is as same as the user entered date pairs.

### How to use

1. **From standard input**

Input date pairs like this:
```
11 01 1991, 11 02 1991
11 09 2001, 11 09 2011
11 10 2010, 11 02 1998
```
Then click the `run` button on the page.

2. **From a txt file**

Click the `from file` radio button. Upload a `txt` file which stores date pairs in correct format (mentioned in assumptions). Run~~~
